                <b>&quot;Kramer vs. Kramer: On the Importance of Children and Divorce Filings for Understanding Divorce Rates in the U.S.&quot;</b><br>
		     PDF version [<a href="papers/JMP.pdf">pdf</a>]

  I document that approximately 70% of divorce filings in the 1970's were done by wives in the United States. Since then, this figure has experienced a large decline, reaching 56% in 2015. At the same time, divorce rates sharply increased from 1960 until the mid 1980s and have declined since then.  I construct a life cycle model of endogenous marriage and unilateral divorce with endogenous labor supply and savings that jointly explains these facts. I use my model to measure the contribution of changes in the gender-wage gap, property division laws and child custody arrangements in explaining the divorce patterns over time. First, the reduction in the gender-wage gap generates two opposing effects. On the one hand, the reduction of the gender-wage gap increases the value of divorce for married women and, on the other hand, unmarried women become more selective in the marriage market thus raising the quality of newly formed matches. Second, children increase the value of divorce for the custodial parent; so a higher probability of getting child custody raises the chances of filing for divorce. Third, a higher share of assets assigned to wives upon divorce can either increase or decrease divorce rates by altering the savings decision of the household. My model accounts for approximately 50 per cent of the decline in divorce filings and 70 per cent of the variation in divorce rates between 1970 and 2015. I find that the decrease in the gender-wage gap and the increase in the probability of getting child custody for men are major drivers behind the changes in divorce rates and in divorce filings, respectively. Importantly, I find that failure to match who files for divorce can lead to opposite counterfactual results.

                <b>&quot;A Quantitative Theory of the HIV Epidemic:Education, Risky Sex and Asymmetric Learning&quot;</b> with Daniela Iorio and Raül Santàeulalia-Llopis<br>

				We show empirically that the relationship between education and the probability of HIV infection is positive at early and later stages of the HIV epidemic; forming a U-shape (positive-zero-positive) over the course of the epidemic. Risky sex is increasing in education thus exhibiting a similar U-shape pattern. In contrast, the relationship between education and knowledge about the process of HIV infection follows an inverted U-shape. To explain these facts, we develop a non-stationary quantitative macroeconomic theory where agents, get (endogenously) infected through risky sex, differ in education, learn asymmetrically about the infection process and have different access to treatment. Our results show (1) that asymmetric learning, where the educated learn and adjust their sexual behaviour faster than the rest, is key to reproduce the initial decline of the HIV-education gradient (2) that differences in treatment coverage by education, increase the educated’s consumption of risky sex, thus explaining the later rebound of the gradient. Furthermore, we find that income is a major driver of the gradient. At the aggregate level, we show that learning and income differences mainly determine the evolution of the HIV epidemic. Finally, we conduct policy experiments where we assess the effects of improvements in the composition of education, an early understanding of the virus and its mode of infection, an earlier (and universal) adoption of anti-retrovirals (ARVs) and the use of pre-exposure treatment (PrEP) to prevent further spread.

In contrast, the relationship between education and knowledge about the process of HIV infection follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. We develop a non-stationary quantitative macroeconomic theory with heterogeneous agents that is consistent with these facts.  Our theory endogeneizes the entire course of the HIV epidemic across its different stages: apre-HIV epidemic stage; a myopic HIV stage in which agents are not aware of the process ofHIV infection; a learning stage in which agents heterogeneously—across education groups—learn about the process of infection; and an anti-retroviral (ARV) stage that modifies the  effects of HIV infection on individuals. We show that asymmetric learning is key to reproduce both the micro patterns that we document and the aggregate evolution of the HIV epidemic. In further counterfactual experiments, we assess the effects of an early understanding of the virus and its mode of infection, improvements in the composition ofeducation, the earlier (and  universal) adoption of ARVs and the use of PrEP to preventfurther spread.-->

                <b>&quot;A Stage-Based Identification of Policy Effects&quot;</b> with Christopher Busch, Alexander Ludwig and Raül Santaeulàlia-Llopis<br>
                PDF version  [<a href="papers/SBI.pdf">pdf</a>]. <br>
		   
 </p>

			
				<p align="justify">
We develop a method that identifies the effects of policy implemented nationwide—i.e. across all regions at the same time. Starting point is the insight that the dynamics of many outcome variables can be tracked over stages. A stage is defined as the location of a regional outcome on a reference outcome path. Our method consists of a normalization that maps the time-path of regional outcomes onto a reference outcome path using only pre-policy data. After normalization, the pre-policy outcome paths mapped onto the reference path are identical across regions which implies that the normalization controls for pre-policy regional heterogeneity (the so-called “parallel trends") without taking a stand on its source, (un)observability or (non)constancy. Since regions can differ by stage at any point in time, the normalization uncovers variation in the stage at the time of policy implementation—even in instances where the implementation occurs at the same time across regions. We use this stage variation at the time of policy implementation to identify the policy effects: a stage-leading region delivers the counterfactual path of the outcome variable after policy. Since the non-leading regions react to policy, our identification of policy effects is not subject to the Lucas critique. Our identification assumption is that the normalization conducted using pre-policy data holds post policy. We validate our method with a set of Monte-Carlo experiments. We show several applications including public health stay-home policies (i.e. the national lockdown against Covid-19 in Spain), the effects of the pill (i.e. the FDA nationwide approval of oral contraceptives in 1960 in the U.S.) on women’s fertility and career choice and the effects of growth policy (e.g. German Reunification).

                <b>&quot;Evaluating the Effectiveness of Policies Against a Pandemic&quot;</b> with Christopher Busch, Alexander Ludwig and Raül Santaeulàlia-Llopis<br>
		   PDF version [<a href="papers/SBI_L.pdf">pdf</a>].
                <br>
                 A post on this article appeared in the <a href="https://focus.bse.eu/how-to-evaluate-effectiveness-covid-19-lockdown-policies/">Barcelona SE Focus</a> blog. <br>
           
            </p>

		<p align="justify">
		We apply a novel method to evaluate policies against a pandemic. In the context of the application, the essence of our approach is the insight that epidemic dynamics are best tracked over stages, rather than over time. The application focuses on the nationwide stay-home policy enacted in Spain against the Covid-19 pandemic. We find that the policy saved 16.8% of lives relative to the number of deaths that would have occurred had it not been for the policy intervention. Its effectiveness evolves with the epidemic and is larger when implemented at earlier stages.

				We compute a measure of agricultural TPF for Bolivian Agricultural Production Units (APU) before and after the 2006 agricultural reform. Using very detailed farm level census data on input and output quantities in production we are able back out individual farm productivity for the years 1984 and 2013. We then conduct a missallocation exercise where we observe a reduction of the degree of factor missallocation between the years 1984 and 2013, probably associated to the 2006 land reform.
